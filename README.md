# Python_Projects
I have completed two projects namely Tic Tac Toe game and Blackjack card game while undertaking the course "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python" on Udemy.

Tic Tac Toe game
<br>
Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The grid is displayed electronically. Each player takes turns marking an empty cell in the grid, with one player using "X" and the other using "O". The objective of the game is to be the first to place three of their marks (X's or O's) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. I completed this project using my knowledge on Python Data Types, Loops and Functions.

Blackjack card game
<br>
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a thrilling card game played in casinos worldwide. It pits human player against the computer dealer, with the goal of achieving a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Each card in the standard 52-card deck holds a specific point value, with numbered cards worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) worth 10 points each, and Aces worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what benefits the player's hand the most. At the beginning of each round, human player is dealt two cards face up, while the computer dealer receives one card face up and one face down. Human player then have the option to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). After human player have completed their turn, the computer dealer reveals their hole card(computer dealer's face-down card) and follows specific rules for drawing additional cards, typically hitting until reaching a hand value of 17 or higher. The round concludes with payouts based on the outcome: human player with a hand value closer to 21 than the computer dealer's without busting win, or else computer delaer wins the round. I was able to complete this project with my knowledge in Object Oriented Programming.
